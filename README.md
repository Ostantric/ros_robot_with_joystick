# rtos_robot_with_joystick

This is a simple arduino project that uses multiple sonar sensors to detect obstacles and avoid them while you drive your robot. I used multiple libraries such as newping, adafruit_pwm. This project was actually for a school work and I implemented into arduino. I used FreeRTOS, it has a minimal kernel size. 4 tasks have indivual priorities. Joystick was used to control the wheelchair. Custom made pcb was used in the school project but you can just buy adafruit's 12 bit pwm driver with Arduino Uno.
